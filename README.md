  Kobi Gatsby
</h1>

Static site version of Kobi using React Gatsby, allowing better performance and versatility. 

## 🚀 Start Developing

1.  Clone this repository to your device.

2.  **Start developing.**

    Open the folder in your favorite text editor and run the following command.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop *or* npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: We'll also have a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you we use to query our Wordpress data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

  
## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├────components
    ├────pages
    ├────images
    ├────styles
    ├────templates 
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
    a. **`/src/pages`** is where we save the pages used in our project. This folder is also where the routing is configured.
    b. **`/src/templates`** is where we save the templates used in for our page generation.
    c. **`/src/components`** is where we save reusable component modules for our project.
    d. **`/src/styles`** is where we save the styling/css used in our project.
    e. **`/src/images`** is where we save the images used in our project.
    
3.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

4.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: We use Gatsby Node to generate static pages based on GraphiQL query results. Look here for further information [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/).

That'll be all the components that we're using in Kobi-Gatsby.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby
